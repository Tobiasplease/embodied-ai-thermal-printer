# üéôÔ∏è Voice System Integration Complete!

## ‚úÖ What's Been Added

### New Files:
1. **`voice.py`** - Complete voice system with async speech queue
2. **`test_voice.py`** - Test script to verify Piper installation
3. **`VOICE_SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions
4. **`VOICE_QUICK_REF.md`** - Quick reference guide

### Modified Files:
1. **`config.py`** - Added 4 voice settings
2. **`main.py`** - Integrated voice system (fully toggleable)

## üéØ Current Status

**Voice is DISABLED by default** - your system works exactly as before!

To enable:
```python
# In config.py, change this line:
VOICE_ENABLED = False  # Change to True
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Test Without Setup (Verify Integration)
```bash
# This will show "Voice system disabled (Piper not found)" - that's OK!
python main.py
```
System runs normally, just without voice.

### Option 2: Full Voice Setup (~5 minutes)
1. Download Piper (~10MB): https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases
2. Extract to `./piper/`
3. Download voice model: https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices
4. Test: `python test_voice.py`
5. Enable in config: `VOICE_ENABLED = True`
6. Run: `python main.py`

### Option 3: Quick Fallback (System TTS)
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```
Then modify `voice.py` to use pyttsx3 (lower quality but instant).

## üéõÔ∏è Voice Settings (config.py)

```python
# Voice Settings
VOICE_ENABLED = False          # Master switch
VOICE_MODEL = "en_US-lessac-medium"  # Voice personality
VOICE_ALL_THOUGHTS = False     # False = periodic, True = every thought
VOICE_INTERVAL = 30            # Seconds between speech (if not all thoughts)
```

## üîß Integration Details

### Where Voice Triggers:
```
AI processes frame
  ‚Üì
Generates thought
  ‚Üì
Cleans caption
  ‚Üì
Sends to thermal printer
  ‚Üì
üéôÔ∏è VOICE SPEAKS HERE (if enabled)
  ‚Üì
Updates subtitle display
```

### Thread Safety:
- Voice runs in background thread
- Async queue prevents blocking
- Zero impact on camera/AI timing
- Graceful shutdown integrated

### Auto-Detection:
- System checks for Piper on startup
- If not found: prints warning, continues without voice
- If found: starts voice system automatically
- No manual intervention needed

## üìä Voice Modes Comparison

| Mode | Setting | Interval | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Off** | `VOICE_ENABLED = False` | N/A | Silent operation (default) |
| **Periodic** | `VOICE_ENABLED = True`<br>`VOICE_ALL_THOUGHTS = False`<br>`VOICE_INTERVAL = 30` | Every 30s | Long sessions, less overwhelming |
| **Continuous** | `VOICE_ENABLED = True`<br>`VOICE_ALL_THOUGHTS = True` | Every 7s | Maximum immersion, intense |

## üé§ What Gets Spoken

Example AI thought:
```
[12:34:56] üß† I'm curious. I notice this room and the way the light hits the wall.
```

Voice speaks:
```
"I'm curious. I notice this room and the way the light hits the wall."
```

Automatically removed:
- ‚úÖ Timestamps `[12:34:56]`
- ‚úÖ Emoji `üß†üí≠üéØ`
- ‚úÖ Debug markers `[DEBUG]`
- ‚úÖ System metadata

## üîç Testing

### Test 1: Verify Integration (No Setup Needed)
```bash
python main.py
```
Should see: `üîá Voice system disabled (config)`
System runs normally ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Test Voice Module
```bash
python test_voice.py
```
If Piper not installed: Shows setup instructions
If Piper installed: Speaks 4 test phrases

### Test 3: Full System with Voice
```bash
# 1. Set VOICE_ENABLED = True in config.py
# 2. Run:
python main.py
```
Should see: `‚úÖ Voice system ready (model: en_US-lessac-medium)`

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If Piper missing, system continues without voice
2. **No Blocking**: Voice runs async, never blocks AI or camera
3. **Clean Shutdown**: Voice stops cleanly on Ctrl+C
4. **Error Handling**: Voice errors don't crash main system
5. **Toggle Any Time**: Change `VOICE_ENABLED` without code changes

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test current setup**: `python main.py` (should work as before)
2. **Decide on voice**: Want it? Follow VOICE_SETUP.md
3. **Test voice separately**: `python test_voice.py`
4. **Enable if desired**: Set `VOICE_ENABLED = True` in config.py
5. **Tune settings**: Adjust `VOICE_INTERVAL` to your preference

## üé® Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Emotional voice modulation (pitch/rate based on mood)
- [ ] Multiple voice personalities
- [ ] Voice queue priority for urgent thoughts
- [ ] SSML markup for expressive speech
- [ ] Voice gender selection
- [ ] Speed/pitch controls

## üí° Tips

- **First run**: Keep `VOICE_ALL_THOUGHTS = False` - continuous speech is intense!
- **Long sessions**: 30-60s interval is comfortable
- **Testing**: Use short intervals (10-15s) to verify quickly
- **Performance**: Voice has ~200ms latency, fine for 7s AI intervals
- **Interruptions**: Voice queue clears on priority speech

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"Voice system disabled (Piper not found)"**
- Normal if you haven't installed Piper yet
- See VOICE_SETUP.md for installation
- System works fine without it

**"Voice system disabled (not available)"**
- Import error in voice.py
- Check: `python -c "from voice import VoiceSystem"`

**No sound but no errors**
- Check Windows volume/speakers
- Verify Piper: `./piper/piper.exe --version`
- Run `test_voice.py` for diagnostics

**Voice too fast/slow**
- Different voice model (see VOICE_SETUP.md)
- Or modify Piper speed settings in voice.py

## ‚ú® Summary

**Integration: Complete ‚úÖ**
**Default State: Voice OFF**
**Impact on Existing System: ZERO**
**Ready to Test: YES**

Your system will run exactly as before unless you explicitly enable voice!
