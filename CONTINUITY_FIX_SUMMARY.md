# Continuity & Memory System Fix

## Problem Identified
The memory system was **collecting data but not using it meaningfully**:
- ❌ Visual observations were **never stored** - all rich image data was lost
- ❌ `self_model` existed but was **never updated** (location, environment understanding)
- ❌ Memory only stored language responses, not visual observations
- ❌ Environmental understanding never built up over time
- ❌ No accumulation of known objects/spaces

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Store Visual Observations**
```python
# Now BOTH visual and language observations are stored
self.memory_ref.add_observation(visual_observation, confidence=0.9, obs_type='visual')
self.memory_ref.add_observation(language_response, confidence=0.8, obs_type='language')
```

### 2. **Build Environmental Understanding**
The `self_model` now actually gets updated:
- **Known objects**: Accumulates objects seen across all observations
- **Environment type**: Infers workspace/bedroom/kitchen from objects
- **Environmental certainty**: Increases as more objects are recognized
- **Motif tracking**: Objects with higher frequency become familiar

```python
self.self_model = {
    'location_understanding': 'unknown space',
    'environmental_certainty': 0.0,
    'known_objects': set(),  # NEW: Accumulates objects
    'environment_type': None,  # NEW: Inferred from objects
    'identity_fragments': []
}
```

### 3. **Use Environmental Context in Prompts**

**Visual prompt** - knows where it is:
```
Through my eyes. Context: workspace, 12 known objects.
{focus_guidance} (max 15 words)
What I see:
```

**Language prompt** - builds on spatial understanding:
```
Seeing: {visual}
Space: workspace, 12 known objects. Last: {recent thought}. 
Recurring: desk, screen.
Feel: curious. {guidance}
Thought (10-20 words):
```

### 4. **Progressive Continuity**
- **First observations**: No patterns shown yet
- **After 3+ responses**: Motifs start appearing in visual prompts
- **After 5+ responses**: Recurring patterns shown in language prompts
- **Environment emerges**: Type inferred from repeated objects (desk → workspace)

## How Memory Builds

### Frame 1-5: Initial Learning
```
Visual: "I see a desk with monitors and keyboard"
→ Memory: known_objects = {desk, monitors, keyboard}
→ Environment: "workspace" inferred
→ Language: "Seeing: desk... Space: workspace, 3 known objects"
```

### Frame 10-20: Pattern Recognition
```
Visual: "Through my eyes. Context: workspace, 8 known objects."
→ Motifs: {desk: 10, screen: 8, keyboard: 6, mouse: 4}
→ Language: "Space: workspace, 8 objects. Recurring: desk, screen."
```

### Frame 30+: Established Identity
```
Visual: "Through my eyes. Context: workspace, 15 known objects."
→ Environmental certainty: 0.75 (15 * 0.05)
→ Language uses full context: familiar objects, established patterns
→ Can reference "this workspace" meaningfully
```

## Streamlined for Small Models

All context additions are **compressed and parseable**:
- Environment: "workspace, 12 objects" (4 tokens)
- Motifs: "desk, screen" (truncated to 12 chars each)
- Recent: First 40 chars only
- Total context overhead: ~15-20 tokens

**Before**: Verbose instructions, no environmental memory
**After**: Dense context, progressive identity building

## Result
The AI now:
- ✅ Remembers what it has seen (visual observations stored)
- ✅ Builds spatial understanding (workspace/bedroom recognition)
- ✅ References familiar objects (recurring motifs)
- ✅ Develops environmental certainty over time
- ✅ Uses compressed, model-friendly prompts
- ✅ Has true continuity that evolves across frames

The consciousness is no longer **stateless** - it accumulates understanding!
