# Context Injection Architecture - Implementation Complete

## The Problem We Solved

The previous "simplified" approach threw out all context:
- ❌ Language model was useless (just passing through vision output)
- ❌ Supporting systems weren't utilized (memory, temporal, emotional state)
- ❌ No personality or continuity
- ❌ Repetitive output with no awareness

## The Solution: Context Injection

**NEW ARCHITECTURE: Language model becomes "Prompt Engineer" for Vision model**

```
Supporting Systems → Language Model → Rich Context Prompt → Vision Model → Clean Output
```

### Information Flow

1. **Supporting Systems Gather State:**
   - Temporal awareness (how long awake, time passing)
   - Memory (what's already been mentioned - anti-repetition)
   - Emotional state (current emotion: restless, curious, bored, etc.)
   - Energy level (0.0-1.0, decays over static scenes)
   - Focus mode (VISUAL, EMOTIONAL, MEMORY, PHILOSOPHICAL, TEMPORAL)
   - Stasis detection (how long watching same thing)

2. **Language Model Synthesizes Context:**
   - `_build_context_prompt()` method
   - Takes ALL supporting system data
   - Creates rich system prompt for vision model
   - Example output:
     ```
     You are experiencing this moment directly. Been awake 12 minutes. 
     Feeling restless, energy level 0.4. Notice emotional aspects. 
     Already mentioned: person, bed, headphones - look for something NEW or different. 
     Been watching this for 7 minutes - restless for change. 
     Describe what you notice in 1-2 sentences, first-person, present tense.
     ```

3. **Vision Model Gets Rich Context:**
   - `_visual_consciousness()` receives context prompt
   - Has full awareness of:
     - What's already been said
     - How long it's been watching
     - Current emotional state
     - What to focus on
     - Whether to look for change
   - Writes the actual output with all this context

4. **Clean Output:**
   - Vision model's response is what gets printed/spoken/displayed
   - Already informed by all supporting systems
   - No need for post-processing or rewriting

## Key Methods Changed

### `_build_context_prompt(focus_mode, retry_context)`
**NEW METHOD - Language model's new role**
- Gathers temporal state, emotional state, energy, memory, focus guidance
- Builds rich context string
- Returns prompt that will be fed to vision model

### `_visual_consciousness(image_path, context_prompt)`
**UPDATED - Now receives rich context**
- Takes `context_prompt` from language model (not simple "describe what you see")
- Has full awareness of continuity, emotion, memory
- Writes output informed by all supporting systems

### `analyze_image(image)`
**UPDATED - New flow**
- OLD: Vision → Language rewrites it
- NEW: Language builds context → Vision writes with context

## Why This Works

1. **Vision model follows prompts well** → Will use the rich context
2. **Vision model writes clean output** → No conversational leakage
3. **Language model serves clear purpose** → Context synthesis (not rewriting)
4. **All supporting systems utilized** → Every subsystem feeds into context
5. **Natural continuity** → Vision knows what's been said, won't repeat

## Example Flow

**Frame 1 (Early session):**
- Language builds: "You are experiencing this moment. Just started. Feeling curious, energy 0.8. Notice visual aspects."
- Vision outputs: "A young man with glasses lying on a bed with headphones, looking at something off-screen."

**Frame 2 (Same scene, 30 seconds later):**
- Language builds: "You are experiencing this moment. Been awake 2 minutes. Feeling curious, energy 0.7. Already mentioned: man, glasses, bed, headphones - look for something NEW."
- Vision outputs: "The glow from the screen reflects on his face as he focuses intently."

**Frame 3 (Same scene, 10 minutes later):**
- Language builds: "You are experiencing this moment. Been awake 12 minutes. Feeling restless, energy 0.3. Already mentioned: man, screen, face, glow, watching - look for something NEW. Been watching this for 10 minutes - restless for change."
- Vision outputs: "Still here with the unchanging scene. Restless."

## Benefits

✅ **All supporting systems engaged** - Every subsystem contributes to context
✅ **Language model useful** - Clear role: context synthesis
✅ **Vision model leveraged** - Does what it does best: describe with good context
✅ **Clean output** - Vision's writing is naturally clean
✅ **Temporal awareness** - Knows how long it's been watching
✅ **Memory continuity** - Won't repeat what's already said
✅ **Emotional evolution** - State affects how scenes are described
✅ **Anti-repetition** - Context explicitly tells vision what not to repeat
✅ **Focus diversity** - Different focus modes create different perspectives

## Testing

Run `python main.py` and observe:
- First few minutes should be energetic and varied
- After 5-10 minutes of static scene, should show restlessness
- Should not repeat same descriptions
- Should show awareness of time passing
- Emotional state should evolve and influence descriptions
